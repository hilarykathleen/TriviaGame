# TriviaGame

Welcome welcome to my trivia game featuring multiple choice questions of scientiic nature.  Our task with this assignment was to create a collection of questions displayed within a window of time.  Score to be revealed at the end of the 'quiz' as well as option to reset. Once the timer has run out, if question hasn't been answered the next question will appear. 

Made it as far as description above, left to code for advanced option would be to display congrats or fail display according to player selection.  Hence my game has landed somewhere between basic and advanced.  Enjoy!
